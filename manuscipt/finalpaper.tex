\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Use this section to answer three questions:
Why is the topic important/interesting?
  The topic of mainstream pop music is one of contention and intrigue. Stardom is the state or status of being a famous or exceptionally talented performer in the world of entertainment (cite Oxford dictionary at some point). The conversation of an artist's ability to produce lasting and iconic materials begins with the history of an artist themselves. Taylor Swift's background 
What has been done on this topic in the literature?
What is your contribution?
My contribution to the work that has already been done is a method of determining how unique a song is by the proportion of unrepeated lyrics in the entire song. I will do this by putting all of the text in a spreadsheet, analyzing the text for words that do not repeat in the song, and counting them. The proportion of unrepeated words to total words is what I will be comparing amogst albums.  



To cite a reference, here are examples.
\citet{xie2015dynamic} did something ... 

A lot of work has been done \citep[e.g.,][]{xie2015dynamic}.

Some parametric bootstrap sample size approach was proposed by
\citet{dwivedi2017analysis}. 


% roadmap
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The data will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:data}.
The methods are described in Section~\ref{sec:meth}.
The results are reported in Section~\ref{sec:resu}.
A discussion concludes in Section~\ref{sec:disc}.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

Use this section to describe the data that helps to answer your research
questions. Recall Einstein's equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mc2}
  E = m c^2,
\end{equation}
which states that the energy $E$ of a particle in its rest frame as the product
of mass ($m$) with the speed of light squared ($c^2$).

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

Use this section to present the methodologies that will generate results by
analyzing the data. Suppose that the radius of a circle is $r$. Then its area is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:area}
  \pi r^2.
\end{equation}

Equation~\eqref{eq:area} is interesting. 

Sometimes I don't want an equation to be numbered such as this one:
\[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( - \frac{x^2}{2} \right),
\]
which is the density of a standard normal variable.



\section{Results}
\label{sec:resu}

Table~\ref{tab:rv} summarizes some example draws from some distributions.
