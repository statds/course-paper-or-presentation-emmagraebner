\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
	My project will be a statistical analysis of Taylor Swift's album, Folklore. I will be analyzing both the uniqueness of Swift's lyrical prose and the simplicity of her melodic lines as compared to other well-known Pop artists in an effort to statistically determine whether Taylor Swift's music is unlike any other.
