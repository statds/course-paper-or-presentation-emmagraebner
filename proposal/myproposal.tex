\paragraph{Introduction}
My overarching research question is to discover what makes music unique using a model that takes two factors, lyrics and time Taylor Swift is one of the most famous Pop singers in the modern era of music. Her music is influential, she is one of the highest grossing American artists; still selling out stadiums and earning awards for her albums and singles \citep{fogarty2021you} . Her style has changed from country to pop to indie folk as her career has advanced. My project will research the relationship between the time Taylor Swift has been an artist, to the complexity of her pieces. \citep{sloan2021taylor}
